# Welcome Note:
### Hey folks, finally you've made it! Welcome, to the Flutter Vadodara Community.

# How did we came into existence?
### There was a vision to establish a Flutter Community by a bunch of few people of the Mozilla Gujarat Community to help all the Flutter enthusiasts to get started with Flutter and to help them out in the field of cross platform App development, to build Web Apps or beautiful Websites using Flutter. With the same initiative, a month-long Flutter Bootcamp was organized and thus the this amazing community came into existence.

# Current Scenario:
### Presently, Flutter Vadodara is a thriving, one of the most active communities and is continuously evolving by a constant arrival of newcomers. 

# Highlights of past events:
### As they say, "Great stories have small beginnings", similarly we started with a survey, then organized a bootcamp after receiving an overwhelming response which turned out to be even great. So, here are few glimpses of the bootcamp and the other meet-ups organized by the Flutter Vadodara Community.
